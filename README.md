# School Projecten 2 - Frontend
Our second school project was seperated in a backend and frontend part. The frontend is made in the Java.

This project was for a real client, with a real life problem. The goal is to create a virtual simulation of a 'BreakOutBox' game. A teacher was able to create a set of challenges, provided by the teacher and sorted into categories, then the student who were divided in groups were able to join the session and start playing the game.

In the end there is a practical challenge and if solved succesfully the students got the key to open the treasure chest and win the game.
